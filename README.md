# Frequency-Divider-circuit
I've designed this"Frequency Divider Circuit" using Xilinx ISE 14.7. The goal of this project was to design the hardware schematic that takes a 100 MHz clock as input and gives the output frequency totally based on the mode selected by the user.  The designed sequential circuit can convert 100 MHz frequency to 1 Hz, 100 Hz, 1 kHz, and 1MHz frequencies..
